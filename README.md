# File organizer
This is a code created to help you organize all your files at the directory you choose in Windows. You're completly free to choose if you organize all of them by once or just some of them.

## How to use
To use this file organizer follow the following instructions:
⋅⋅* Clone this repository using git clone. Make sure you clone it in "Desktop" directory and don't change its name, otherwise it won't work properly.
⋅⋅* Execute your favorite IDE/Editor as administrator and open this repository's folder.
⋅⋅* Execute the "make_key.py" file. This will generate a key to use the file organizer with menu context (The window that pops up when you use right click)
If everything works properly now you'll be able to right click inside the folder you want to organize to execute this script using the menu context. If you're using Windows 11 click on "Show more options" and then you'll see and option that says "Organize files from this folder".
If this doesn't work then you'll have to place the "file_organizer.exe" file inside the folder you want to organize and then double click it. This will take the executable to the "Others" folder that will be created.
If this last thing doesn't work either then you'll have to move the "main.py" and "file_organizer_functions.py" files to the folder you want to organize. Then you'll have to use your CMD to use the "main.py".
