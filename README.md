# File organizer
This is a code created to help you organize all your files at the directory you choose in Windows. You're completly free to choose if you organize all of them or just some of them.

## How to use
To use this file organizer follow the instructions:
* Clone this repository using git clone. Make sure you clone it in "Desktop" directory and don't change its name, otherwise it won't work properly.
* If you directly download the files make sure you stored them in a Folder called "File organizer" located at the "Desktop" directory.
* Right click on the "make_key.exe" file and click "Run as administrator". This will ask for permitions, click on "Yes".

Now you'll be able to right click inside the folder you want to organize. If you're using Windows 10 you'll see an option that says "Organize files from this folder", just click it and this script will execute.
If you're using Windows 11 just right click and then click on "Show more options", then everything will be as in Windows 10.

## What if make_key didn't work
If this didn't work then follow these instructions:
* Put the "file_organizer.exe" file inside the folder you want to organize and then double click it.
* If the "Others" folder is created then the executable will be moved to that folder.
* Repeat these instructions if you want to use the executable again.

## file_organizer.exe didn't work
If that didn't work either then follow these final instructions:
* Move both "main.py" and "file_organizer_functions.py" files to the folder you want to organize.
* Once you did it just open your CMD on the directory you want to organize and run the "main.py" file using the command "python main.py".

This will execute the script to organize your folder. If "Others" folder is created then both files will be moved there and you'll have to take them out when you want to use it again.
